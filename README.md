### In this section, I will process one dataset and task with related problems to solve using the tools that leared in August 2020 including:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Plotly.express

### My analysis contain:
- Python code for data cleaning, manipulation and exploration.

### My analysis contain 3 part:
- Overview: Reports the latest situation of the Corona Virus in a given country - the country where the report is from and other information:
  Total confirmed cases, Total death, Total recovered
- Visualize the confirmed, death and recovered cases over time of the top 5 countries by the current total number of confirmed cases.
- Deeper inside about the situation of top 5 countries? Among the top 5 countries (by the current total number of confirmed cases), which country(s) we should pay special attention to?
